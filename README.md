# parking-space-website
this is my a-level project where I create a website to register vehicles and parking spaces for cars.

users can put in their vehicle details to register for parking, where they can input how long they want to park for and a price will be generated per hour of parking and for every 5 minutes they are parked overtime, a fee is added on top of their parking cost.
